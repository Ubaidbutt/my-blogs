I was born and raised a Muslim and followed the religion closely while living with my family. During college, I started to drift a little, but it was truly when I went to university in another city that I really lost touch with my faith. I wasn't practicing as much, only doing a few small things here and there.

I can't point to any one thing that caused this change. I feel like I'm a typical example of many young people in my country who are taught to follow Islam without really understanding the why behind it. So, I followed it because my family did, and I didn't want to upset them.

But once I had more freedom and could make my own choices, I didn't feel the need to continue because I never truly understood the reasons behind the practices. It was more like a routine I followed because everyone else did.

t has been 10 years since I started university, almost 6 years into my professional life and 3 years after moving to the Netherlands. My distance from religion has only increased during this time. Life gets so busy that you don't spend too much time thinking about spirituality and religion, especially in your early 20s with big dreams and responsibilities.

However, as you move along in life, you do think about these things. For me, it was more about educating myself on the topic because it's a very debatable discussion when you're with friends, especially when you have international friends who ask you questions about your religion.

Out of nowhere, I started listening to this scholar called Javed Ahmad Ghamidi. I was really impressed by him from the start because the kind of Islam he portrays is very different from what I was taught as a child. This created a strong curiosity in me to understand more about his perspective on Islam and compare it to the mainstream version in Pakistan.

When I started listening to him, I began to admire his style of communication, the way he looks at religion and Islam, and especially how he contextualizes Islam instead of blindly following it without understanding. I watched his videos on a variety of topics, mainly around pardah, marriage as an institution, roles and responsibilities of husbands and wives, the existence of God, and more. After watching his videos, I became very interested in knowing the truth about Islam because the Islam he portrays is very different from what I and most of us are used to while living in Pakistan.

I want to study Islam as a student, and my idea is to just read the holy book itself and see how it goes. We don’t need to complicate it. Let’s just pick up a decent copy of the book in a language I understand and read it like I read so many other books. I ordered "The Clear Quran," an English translation of the Quran by Mustafa Khattab. I am going to try to read the book and document my understanding of it on this blog as I progress in this journey.
