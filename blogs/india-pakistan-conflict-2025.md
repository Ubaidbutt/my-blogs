# Introduction
If you are from South Asia or have even a remote interest in global geopolitics, you have likely heard about the recent four-day clashes between India and Pakistan, during which both countries exchanged missile and drone attacks.

Pakistan and India have a long history that goes back to the partition in 1947 and is especially linked with a region called Kashmir. Both countries currently control a part of the region and claim that the other part is rightfully theirs. The history behind this is long and too complex for me to put in this blog, but I am sure a simple Google or YouTube search would give you plenty of resources to delve deeper into this topic.

# Overview of the current conflict
This is what happened on a broad level:
- On April 22nd, a terrorist attack happened in the Indian part of Kashmir, killing 26 civilians, and the Indian state blames Pakistan for the attack.
Pakistan denies responsibility and condemns the attack, even offering a neutral investigation into the incident to find out if Pakistan was involved.
- Over the following two weeks, India expels Pakistani diplomats, cancels visas of Pakistanis, and suspends the international water treaty agreement between India and Pakistan, raising tensions between the two countries.
- On May 7th, India launches an operation in Pakistan, targeting 9 locations they claim are linked with terrorists.
- These attacks killed at least 35 people, including children, and injured around 70 people.
- Pakistan claims to have shot down 5 Indian fighter jets during the dogfight that happened after Pakistan defended against this attack and vows to give a response to India for this attack.
- On May 8th, Indian drones reach major cities of Pakistan, injuring people and inflicting infrastructure damage, while Pakistan shoots down the drones.
- During this time, both countries are fighting heavily on the Line of Control, inflicting damage on both military and civilian populations living close to the border area.
- The next day, India launches a missile attack on at least 11 Pakistani airbases, and while some missiles were intercepted, some were able to hit their targets, inflicting infrastructure damage.
- Pakistan responded by attacking key Indian military installations in parts of India through its air force, claiming to have destroyed infrastructure and missile defense systems.
- On May 10th, while tensions were at an all-time high for an all-out war, President Trump tweets about a ceasefire agreement between the two countries.
- Just around this time, one missile attack from India hits a few Pakistani airbases, killing at least 5 air force personnel and infrastructure damage.
- As it currently stands, the ceasefire is in place, even though there have been reports of some problems around the Line of Control, with both sides blaming each other for violations.

It is true that Pakistan has a history of creating and backing "terrorist" organizations to destabilize Indian Kashmir. This aligns with Pakistan's past involvement in creating and facilitating the Mujahideen to fight America's war with the Soviets in Afghanistan. The consequences of those decisions, made by the military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s, continue to cost Pakistan thousands of civilian lives even now.

It is also a fact that some of these organizations, primarily Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), have carried out several terrorist attacks in India and the Indian part of Kashmir, killing many civilians and military personnel. There have been several collaborative investigations between India and Pakistan to find and punish the culprits, but India accuses Pakistan of dishonesty in these matters.

Coming back to the current attack on April 22nd that killed 26 civilians, Indian media and the state began blaming Pakistan within minutes, vowing revenge. There was no time for investigation; in fact, at the time of writing, Indian forces have not yet found the terrorists, and the operation to find them is ongoing. However, they blame Pakistan due to past incidents. It's as if they're saying, "You're the one who did it because we know you've done this in the past."

# My observation on the 4-day conflict
India may be frustrated and angry about the civilian attack that killed 26 citizens, but attacking another sovereign country with missiles without providing any proof, or even before catching the culprits, is excessive. This is rather apparent in most international media organizations and explains the lack of clear support for the Indian side in this conflict. Even when you believe the other side is responsible, you have to present at least some evidence before initiating an all-out conflict. Pakistan also has terrorist organizations within its borders in Balochistan that regularly carry out terrorist attacks and kill civilians. Pakistan also claims there is evidence of Indian intelligence backing these groups. So, can Pakistan simply send missiles into India based on this claim?
A recent incident on Canadian soil, where a Sikh citizen was killed by Indian agents proven after a thorough investigation by the Canadian police, shows how Canada dealt with the situation by providing clear proof in a press conference and handling the matter diplomatically. I understand India and Pakistan have a more complicated history than this, but I still don't agree with this blatant act of war based on mere gut feeling. If India had found the culprits and established some link to Pakistan, maybe the attacks would have made a bit more sense.

Did the attacks from India only kill terrorists? Even if I don't believe the official Pakistani narrative that none of them were terrorist sites, it's likely that some, or even many, of them were not exclusively terrorist targets. The attacks ended up killing many civilians, if not entirely civilians, including children and women whose dead bodies were all over social media. Based on the previous argument, you cannot attack a sovereign country based on a gut feeling and then also kill innocent children as collateral damage in the process. No country in the world would be okay with that.

India did manage to hit the targets, but not without a huge loss in terms of money and, more importantly, their military capabilities, especially in the air. In response to the attacks, the Indian Air Force lost quite a few of their fighter jets, including the new 5th generation French Rafale, which they initially denied. However, as reported by Reuters, CNN, and other international organizations, there is definitely a lot of truth to this. The Indian Air Chief ended up accepting this recently with his comment that "losses are part of the combat," declining to comment on further details so as not to give any advantage to the enemy.

Yes, India did manage to penetrate major Pakistani cities using drones and later missiles, hitting several Pakistani airbases and inflicting significant damage. However, Pakistan also responded with missiles and drones into Indian cities, causing damage in return. While the extent of the damage on each side, the number of casualties, and the amount of infrastructure destroyed are debatable, the crucial point is that India did not attack and just get away with it without receiving an equal counter-attack.

One thing where Pakistan has given India and the world a huge surprise is their apparent air superiority, having shot down several Indian jets, including the latest Rafale, using their Chinese-made J-10 and JF-17 aircraft without any reported losses. India claims to have shot down Pakistani jets, but no international media outlet has corroborated this, and there are no credible pictures or videos on social media to support this claim.
