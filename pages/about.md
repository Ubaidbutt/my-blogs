Hi, I’m Ubaid R Butt, the founder of this small blog you’ve stumbled upon.

I am a 27-year-old Software Engineer working in the Netherlands as an expat. I have a wide range of interests, from economics, geopolitics, history, and social sciences. Yes, I know it's a bit all over the place, but who says we need to limit our curiosities? I love reading books, and as you can probably tell from this blog, I also have a passion for writing.

I was born and raised in a city called Sialkot in the northeast part of Pakistan. Fun fact: about 70% of the world’s footballs are manufactured and exported from Sialkot, pretty cool, right?

I spent the first 17 years of my life studying in school and college in the city and moved to the capital, Islamabad, for my Bachelor's in Information Technology. The four years in my university were some of the best years of my life. This experience has had a profound impact on my overall personality. After spending four years there, I relocated to another big city in Pakistan called Lahore for my first job in my professional career. I worked for three years for a consultancy startup in Lahore before landing an opportunity with an Amsterdam-based company in 2021. This move started the next big phase of my life, settling and exploring this part of the world.

The last three years here have been a rollercoaster ride both personally and professionally. I have changed jobs, made new friends, changed houses, and traveled to so many countries. Every experience has been a learning opportunity to grow and become a better person. This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts on topics that inspire me, including career, software engineering, politics, social issues, travel, and even religion.
