If you are from South Asia or have even a remote interest in global geopolitics, you have likely heard about the recent four-day clashes between India and Pakistan, during which both countries exchanged missile and drone attacks.

Pakistan and India have a long history that goes back to the partition in 1947 and is especially linked with a region called Kashmir. Both countries currently control a part of the region and claim that the other part is rightfully theirs. The history behind this is long and too complex for me to put in this blog, but I am sure a simple Google or YouTube search would give you plenty of resources to delve deeper into this topic.

# Overview of the current conflict
This is what happened on a broad level:
- On April 22nd, a terrorist attack happened in the Indian part of Kashmir, killing 26 civilians, and the Indian state blames Pakistan for the attack.
Pakistan denies responsibility and condemns the attack, even offering a neutral investigation into the incident to find out if Pakistan was involved.
- Over the following two weeks, India expels Pakistani diplomats, cancels visas of Pakistanis, and suspends the international water treaty agreement between India and Pakistan, raising tensions between the two countries.
- On May 7th, India launches an operation in Pakistan, targeting 9 locations they claim are linked with terrorists.
- These attacks killed at least 35 people, including children, and injured around 70 people.
- Pakistan claims to have shot down 5 Indian fighter jets during the dogfight that happened after Pakistan defended against this attack and vows to give a response to India for this attack.
- On May 8th, Indian drones reach major cities of Pakistan, injuring people and inflicting infrastructure damage, while Pakistan shoots down the drones.
- During this time, both countries are fighting heavily on the Line of Control, inflicting damage on both military and civilian populations living close to the border area.
- The next day, India launches a missile attack on at least 11 Pakistani airbases, and while some missiles were intercepted, some were able to hit their targets, inflicting infrastructure damage.
- Pakistan responded by attacking key Indian military installations in parts of India through its air force, claiming to have destroyed infrastructure and missile defense systems.
- On May 10th, while tensions were at an all-time high for an all-out war, President Trump tweets about a ceasefire agreement between the two countries.
- Just around this time, one missile attack from India hits a few Pakistani airbases, killing at least 5 air force personnel and infrastructure damage.
- As it currently stands, the ceasefire is in place, even though there have been reports of some problems around the Line of Control, with both sides blaming each other for violations.

It is true that Pakistan has a history of creating and backing "terrorist" organizations to destabilize Indian Kashmir. This aligns with Pakistan's past involvement in creating and facilitating the Mujahideen to fight America's war with the Soviets in Afghanistan. The consequences of those decisions, made by the military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s, continue to cost Pakistan thousands of civilian lives even now.

It is also a fact that some of these organizations, primarily Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), have carried out several terrorist attacks in India and the Indian part of Kashmir, killing many civilians and military personnel. There have been several collaborative investigations between India and Pakistan to find and punish the culprits, but India accuses Pakistan of dishonesty in these matters.

Coming back to the current attack on April 22nd that killed 26 civilians, Indian media and the state began blaming Pakistan within minutes, vowing revenge. There was no time for investigation; in fact, at the time of writing, Indian forces have not yet found the terrorists, and the operation to find them is ongoing. However, they blame Pakistan due to past incidents. It's as if they're saying, "You're the one who did it because we know you've done this in the past."

# My observation on the conflict
India may be frustrated and angry about the civilian attack that killed 26 citizens, but attacking another sovereign country with missiles without providing any proof, or even before catching the culprits, is excessive. This is rather apparent in most international media organizations and explains the lack of clear support for the Indian side in this conflict. Even when you believe the other side is responsible, you have to present at least some evidence before initiating an all-out conflict. Pakistan also has terrorist organizations within its borders in Balochistan that regularly carry out terrorist attacks and kill civilians. Pakistan also claims there is evidence of Indian intelligence backing these groups. So, can Pakistan simply send missiles into India based on this claim?
A recent incident on Canadian soil, where a Sikh citizen was killed by Indian agents proven after a thorough investigation by the Canadian police, shows how Canada dealt with the situation by providing clear proof in a press conference and handling the matter diplomatically. I understand India and Pakistan have a more complicated history than this, but I still don't agree with this blatant act of war based on mere gut feeling. If India had found the culprits and established some link to Pakistan, maybe the attacks would have made a bit more sense.

Did the attacks from India only kill terrorists? Even if I don't believe the official Pakistani narrative that none of them were terrorist sites, it's likely that some, or even many, of them were not exclusively terrorist targets. The attacks ended up killing many civilians, if not entirely civilians, including children and women whose dead bodies were all over social media. Based on the previous argument, you cannot attack a sovereign country based on a gut feeling and then also kill innocent children as collateral damage in the process. No country in the world would be okay with that.

India did manage to hit the targets, but not without a huge loss in terms of money and, more importantly, their military capabilities, especially in the air. In response to the attacks, the Indian Air Force lost quite a few of their fighter jets, including the new 5th generation French Rafale, which they initially denied. However, as reported by Reuters, CNN, and other international organizations, there is definitely a lot of truth to this. The Indian Air Chief ended up accepting this recently with his comment that "losses are part of the combat," declining to comment on further details so as not to give any advantage to the enemy.

Yes, India did manage to penetrate major Pakistani cities using drones and later missiles, hitting several Pakistani airbases and inflicting significant damage. However, Pakistan also responded with missiles and drones into Indian cities, causing damage in return. While the extent of the damage on each side, the number of casualties, and the amount of infrastructure destroyed are debatable, the crucial point is that India did not attack and just get away with it without receiving an equal counter-attack.

One thing where Pakistan has given India and the world a huge surprise is their apparent air superiority, having shot down several Indian jets, including the latest Rafale, using their Chinese-made J-10 and JF-17 aircraft without any reported losses. India claims to have shot down Pakistani jets, but no international media outlet has corroborated this, and there are no credible pictures or videos on social media to support this claim.

# Conclusion
Now that the ceasefire is in effect, both countries are claiming victory, suggesting that the agreement likely provided a face-saving exit for both parties. India asserts that they taught Pakistan a lesson by attacking terrorist sites and their airbases. Pakistan claims they retaliated by shooting down Indian jets and attacking their military installations. The nature of modern warfare often obscures a clear outcome, and the reality is that declaring a definitive winner or loser in a war is rarely straightforward. Even in the significantly unbalanced conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Russia has yet to achieve a clear victory despite its apparent advantages. Therefore, in a four-day conflict where both sides actively engaged and now claim victory, determining a conclusive winner is particularly challenging.

What is conclusive is the tragic loss of innocent lives, first in the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequently in the retaliatory attacks from both sides. People living close to the border, especially in the Kashmir region on both sides, bore the heavy burden of two nuclear-armed countries in conflict. Children, women, and soldiers perished, never to return. Both countries inflicted significant infrastructure damage, likely amounting to billions of dollars in losses.

The reality is that this region will likely not see lasting peace without a definitive resolution to the Kashmir issue. With neither India nor Pakistan willing to concede their positions, and with China also holding a portion of the territory, the situation appears poised to worsen. India controls approximately 100,000 square kilometers of the region, while Pakistan and China control 78,000 and 40,000 square kilometers, respectively. Ideally, and according to the UN resolutions, all parties would withdraw from the region to allow for free and fair elections, enabling the people to decide their future â€“ whether to join India, Pakistan, or become an independent nation. However, this scenario seems almost impossible, as no country is willing to cede its territory, especially after India's 2019 decision to revoke Kashmir's special status and integrate it as an official part of India.

If I were in power, I would quite frankly give away the Pakistani side of Kashmir to achieve peace in the region, but that's just my opinion, and I don't think the majority of Pakistanis share my feeling. One possible end could be to simply establish borders along the existing Line of Control, with each country retaining its current portion of the region. However, that would be unfair to the people of Kashmir, who would remain divided between two countries, though perhaps they would accept it compared to the regular conflicts and killings that occur every few years.

I don't know the solution, and probably no one does. These problems, involving complex history, geopolitical situations, and the role of religion, make this extremely difficult. All I know is that our region needs to move beyond this constant state of conflict and start focusing its energies on the actual things that matter, like the welfare of the people. Engaging in this arms race of buying the latest jets and missiles, developing nuclear weapons, and trying to outcompete each other in defense serves nobody except those manufacturing and selling these weapons. India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh could very well form their own South Asian union. We have so much in common â€“ the food, the language, culture, and history â€“ but for one reason or another, we keep finding ways to divide ourselves instead of uniting.
