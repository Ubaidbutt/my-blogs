# Introduction
If you are from South Asia or have even a remote interest in global geopolitics, you have likely heard about the recent four-day clashes between India and Pakistan, during which both countries exchanged missile and drone attacks.

Pakistan and India have a long history that goes back to the partition in 1947 and is especially linked with a region called Kashmir. Both countries currently control a part of the region and claim that the other part is rightfully theirs. The history behind this is long and too complex for me to put in this blog, but I am sure a simple Google or YouTube search would give you plenty of resources to delve deeper into this topic.

# Overview 
This is what happened on a broad level:
- On April 22nd, a terrorist attack happened in the Indian part of Kashmir, killing 26 civilians, and the Indian state blames Pakistan for the attack.
Pakistan denies responsibility and condemns the attack, even offering a neutral investigation into the incident to find out if Pakistan was involved.
- Over the following two weeks, India expels Pakistani diplomats, cancels visas of Pakistanis, and suspends the international water treaty agreement between India and Pakistan, raising tensions between the two countries.
- On May 7th, India launches an operation in Pakistan, targeting 9 locations they claim are linked with terrorists.
- These attacks killed at least 35 people, including children, and injured around 70 people.
- Pakistan claims to have shot down 5 Indian fighter jets during the dogfight that happened after Pakistan defended against this attack and vows to give a response to India for this attack.
- On May 8th, Indian drones reach major cities of Pakistan, injuring people and inflicting infrastructure damage, while Pakistan shoots down the drones.
- During this time, both countries are fighting heavily on the Line of Control, inflicting damage on both military and civilian populations living close to the border area.
- The next day, India launches a missile attack on at least 11 Pakistani airbases, and while some missiles were intercepted, some were able to hit their targets, inflicting infrastructure damage.
- Pakistan responded by attacking key Indian military installations in parts of India through its air force, claiming to have destroyed infrastructure and missile defense systems.
- On May 10th, while tensions were at an all-time high for an all-out war, President Trump tweets about a ceasefire agreement between the two countries.
- Just around this time, one final missile attack from India hits a Pakistani airbase, killing at least 5 air force personnel.
- As it currently stands, currently the ceasefire is in place, even though there have been reports of some problems around the Line of Control, with both sides blaming each other for violations.
