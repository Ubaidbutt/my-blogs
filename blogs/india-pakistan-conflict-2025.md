India and Pakistan are on a verge of another conflict after a recent attack by the Indian military inside Pakistani territory, which they claim was a precise attack on terrorist camps. According to sources, multiple cities were targeted, including Bahawalpur, Muzaffarabad, Sialkot, Muridke, and a few more. At the moment of writing, at least 26 people are confirmed dead, including a child, and at least 50 are injured.

The Indian attack on Pakistani cities occurred after the terrorist attack on April 22nd, which targeted civilian tourists in Pahalgam, the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of 26 people, mostly Hindus. Immediately following the attack, the Indian state and media began blaming Pakistan, accusing them of funding the terrorists and vowing revenge. India initiated its response by severing diplomatic ties, which were already at an all-time low. They also canceled visas for all Pakistanis, including those with medical emergencies, and suspended an international water treaty between India and Pakistan that had been brokered by the World Bank in 1960.

Pakistan officially condemned the attacked and after blatant accusations offered an impartial inquiry of the incident to find the details of any involvement of the Pakistani state. As per the independent media, no such inquiry was conducted nor any proofs provided linking Pakistani government with the attacks.
